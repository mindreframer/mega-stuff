megatools 1.9.92 - 2013-05-??
=============================

This release brings several major improvements to megatools:

- Megatools no longer depend on OpenSSL and cURL, now it uses nettle
  (basis of GnuPG) and GMP library for its cryptography.
- Tools were rewritten on top of megatools' own libmega.
- It is now possible to create and use ephemeral (anonymous) accounts.
  (eg. this allows you to upload files without creating and verifying 
  an account and publish uploaded files to other people)
- Megasync got smarter and faster:
  - Many operations are performed in batch HTTP requests (so it's now
    possible to create hunderds of directories in one HTTP request).
  - Added options to replace changed files, and delete removed files.
  - Added exclude options with globbing support.
- Megaget now supports remote path globbing. (megaget /Root/Dir/*.mp4)
- Megafs allows you to access files in read-only/random access mode.
- Megamv is now implemented.
- Megatools now respect system proxy settings.
- Thumbnails generation can be disabled via command-line switch.
- Downloads can be resumed in megadl and megaget
- You can now use libmega's programming API from JavaScript, Python, and
  other languages that support gobject-introspection, to create
  GUI tools for Mega.co.nz. (the API is reasonably complete, as
  it's used for all the megatools)

Fixed bugs:

- PDF thumbnails taking too much space and cpu time (each page was
  rendered to /tmp, not just the first page).


megatools 1.9.91 - 2013-04-14
=============================

Please note, that megatools is using GNOME release versioning. That means
that in MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, odd MINOR number signifies development version
of the tools. PATCH version is increased on each public release.

By using odd MINOR versions of the software you are using an unstable
branch. That doesn't mean it will be crashing on you, but it may have 
certain quirks, and oddities, missing or incomplete features, etc.

Next stable release is going to be 2.0.0.

To the news:

- Added man pages for all tools
- Removed megastream in favor of mega{dl,get} --path -
- Megadf - fix unsigned overflow when server reports 0 total space
- Implemented --debug option
- Win32: Drop requirement for manual setup of GIO_EXTRA_MODULES
- Load certificates from the binaries folder on windows
- Enable CA validation for TLS connections
- Fix compilation on FreeBSD by adding --enable-warnings
- Add note that on FreeBSD GNU make must be used to build the tools
- Fix typedef redefinitions (error on older gcc's)
- Fix megals --names logic
- megaput/megaget/megadl/megasync: --no-progress support
- Fix mega_session_dl streaming mode segfault
- megamkdir/megarm: Check for required arguments
- Pretty print JSON in debug output

AUR package is available at https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/megatools/

Ubunut PPA is availble at https://launchpad.net/~megous/+archive/ppa

If someone wants to take over packaging for Ubuntu or Debian, that would
be very appretiated, as my speciality is Arch Linux.


megatools 1.9.90 - 2013-04-11
=============================

Implemented much simpler and faster json parser than json-glib, which was
used before. Megatools now use sjson, which you can find at:

  https://github.com/megous/sjson

Json-glib dependency was thus dropped.

Initial work on getting rid of dependency on libcurl.

Initial work on the new libmega library with support for gobject-introspection
based bindings to various languages: JavaScript, Python, Ruby, LUA,...

Experimental implementation of Mega API in JavaScript (gjs), this should help
people develop GNOME GUI for Mega in the future.

New command line tools:

  megafs  - mount mega.co.nz filesystem usong FUSE (Linux only)
  megamv  - move and rename remote files and directories


megatools 1.2.2 - 2013-04-11
============================

Bugs fixed:

- Trash and Inbox paths are no longer mixed up (bug reported by Ovidiu)
- megadl segfault
- megaput --path /Root/nonexistent-file local-file (remote file would get 
  the name of the local file, instead of nonexistent-file)
- megals /Root/file-name would return nothing
- Segfault with password length over 15 chars
- Fix file size parsing to make it work with files over 2GB in size


megatools 1.2.1 - 2013-03-12
============================

Added support for OpenSUSE 12.1 and newer versions.

Build libmega statically for binary distribution to ease installation 
outside of /usr/local.


megatools 1.2.0 - 2013-03-12
============================

Megatools now support download of shared files and folders.

Megatools support creating thumbnails for image and video files uploaded 
to Mega. This is enabled only on Linux, as it requires ffmpegthumbnailer 
and convert (from ImageMagick package).

You can now manage your contacts list via:
  
  - mkdir /Contacts/some@email.com
  - rm /Contacts/some.other@email.com

Exported folders can be downloaded using megadl.

All tools gained a few more options to help with scripting needs.

If you don't provide password on command-line or in config file you'll 
be asked for it when the tool runs.

Megals tool gained many new options.

OpenSSL locks are now properly initialized.


megatools 1.1.1 - 2013-03-10
============================

Binary packages for linux support more Linux distributions. Supported
distros include (both 32bit and 64bit editions):

  - Ubuntu LTS 12.04.2 and later
  - Fedora 17 and later
  - Current Arch Linux
  - Suse (with a package for ubuntu)
  - ...and probably any recent distribution with all dependencies installed

Package structure was changed to allow easy installation to /usr/local.

To install, run:

  sudo tar -x -f megatools-1.1.1-i686.tar.gz -C / --no-overwrite-dir

Tools now use shared library, which you can use to develop your own Mega
tools. For example:

  export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig

  gcc -o sample sample.c -Wl,-rpath,/usr/local/lib `pkg-config --cflags --libs libmega`

Sample source code sample.c can be found in /usr/local/share/doc/megatools/

To develop mega apps, you'll need to install development packages on
distros like Fedora or Ubuntu. For example on Fedora:

  yum install openssl-devel json-glib-devel libcurl-devel glib2-devel

Or on Ubuntu:

  apt-get install libssl-dev libjson-glib-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev gcc make pkg-config


megatools 1.1.0 - 2013-03-09
============================

Megareg tool is now implemented, and can be used to register new
accounts without the need for Mega website. Unless you login to
Mega, Mega will never be able to get your password key.

Tools don't show version banner anymore, unless asked for via 
--version option.

Megadl learned to handle SIGPIPE if server drops connection,
and megadl tries to write into a closed socket.


megatools 1.0.0 - 2013-03-08
============================

This is initial public release of megatools. Current features are:

- Local caching of remote session/filesystem information 
  for faster execution. Cache is encrypted with your password 
  key.
- Support for configuration file to put login information in.
  This is not wildly secure, but it's convenient.
- Initial set of tools to manipulate remote filesystem:

  megadf       Show your cloud storage space usage/quota
  megals       List all remote files
  megamkdir    Create remote directory
  megarm       Remove remote file or directory
  megaput      Upload individual files
  megaget      Download individual files
  megadl       Download file from a "public" Mega link
               (doesn't require login)
  megastream   Streaming download of a file
               (can be used to preview videos or music)
  megasync     Upload or download a directory tree

See TODO for features that are comming in the future releases.
