DESCRIPTION
-----------

Megatools is a collection of programs for accessing Mega service from 
a command line of your desktop or server.

Megatools allow you to copy individual files as well as entire directory 
trees to and from the cloud. You can also perform streaming downloads for 
example to preview videos and audio files, without needing to download 
the entire file.

Megatools are robust and optimized for fast operation - as fast as Mega 
servers allow. Memory requirements and CPU utilization are kept at minimum.

You can register account using a man:megareg[1] tool, with the benefit of having 
true control of your encryption keys.

Mega website can be found at http://mega.co.nz.

Megatools can be downloaded at http://megatools.megous.com

CONFIGURATION FILES
-------------------

See man:megarc[5] for information about mega configuration file.


ACCOUNT TYPES
-------------

Megatools allow you to create and access two account types:

. Ephemeral (temporary anonymous) accounts
. Fully verified permanent accounts associated with an email

To login to ephemeral account you need to provide user handle (11 character
string) and password. To login to standard account, you need to provide email
and password.

Ephemeral account is anonymous, and Mega.co.nz removes these accounts and files
associated with them on regular basis. You can use it if you want to quickly
share a file with someone, and don't care that it may get removed by Mega.co.nz
at any time. Ephemeral accounts don't need email verification step.

* For example:
+
------------
$ megareg --anonymous --password qweqwe
New anonymous account was registered with user handle 'xAsf7a4sDDa'
$ megals --username xAsf7a4sDDa --password qweqwe
/Contacts 
/Inbox 
/Root 
/Trash
------------


SESSION CACHE
-------------

If you modify cloud filesystem from the Mega.co.nz website or from another computer,
you'll need to refresh your session cache. This can be done by using the
--reload option to any tool, or by waiting for a cache timeout (default timeout is set to 10 minutes).


RUNNING FROM CONSOLE (DEALING WITH WARNINGS)
--------------------------------------------

Megatools uses gio library which reads some configuration options from dconf via
dbus. This poses no problems when you run megatools from within a desktop
environment.

If you want to run megatools from console, in order to avoid warnings like this:

------------
** WARNING **: Error spawning command line 
  `dbus-launch --autolaunch=62d47e5eda4e964df3953a9c000004de 
  --binary-syntax --close-stderr': Failed to execute child 
  process "dbus-launch" (No such file or directory)
------------

or this:

------------
** WARNING **: Command line 
  `dbus-launch --autolaunch=71897713888b9be27b7527c85194adf8 
  --binary-syntax --close-stderr' exited with non-zero 
  exit status 1: Autolaunch error: X11 initialization failed.
------------

you need to setup dbus session bus yourself. This can be done automatically using
man:dbus-launch[1] program. All you need to do is run the individual tools
using man:dbus-launch[1], like this:

------------
$ dbus-launch megals
$ dbus-launch megadf --human
------------

Also, if your system doesn't have man:dconf[1] installed, you may also get this
warning:

-----------
GLib-GIO-Message: Using the 'memory' GSettings backend.  Your 
  settings will not be saved or shared with other applications.
-----------

To solve it, install man:dconf[1].

These are just warnings, and megatools should run fine even if you see them.
