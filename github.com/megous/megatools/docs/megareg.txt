NAME
----
megareg - Register new Mega.co.nz account


SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'megareg' [--script] --email <email> --name <realname> --password <password>
'megareg' [--script] --anonymous --password <password>
'megareg' [--script] --verify <link> --state <state> 


DESCRIPTION
-----------

Registers a new Mega.co.nz account. You must read and agree to
link:http://g.static.mega.co.nz/pages/terms.html[Mega.co.nz terms of service],
before using Mega.co.nz in any way.

Registration is split into two steps:

. Creating a new Mega.co.nz account
. Verifying account with the link that was sent to `<email>`

You can also create what Mega.co.nz calls ephemeral account. This account is
anonymous, and Mega.co.nz removes these accounts and files associated with 
them on regular basis. You can use it if you want to quickly share a file
with someone, and don't care that it may get removed by Mega.co.nz at any time.

Ephemeral accounts don't need email verification step.

See examples of registration below.


OPTIONS
-------

--anonymous::
	Create ephemeral (temporary anonymous) account instead of a regular
        verified account.

--verify <link>::
	Verify account previously created by `megareg`. You need to
	pass `<state>` that was returned from `megareg` and
	a verification link from the email that was sent to `<email>`.

--email <email>::
	Email serves as your new account username. You'll be using it to sign
	in to Mega.co.nz.

--name <realname>::
	Your real (or fake) name.

--password <password>::
	Plaintext password. No strength checking is done, so make sure you pick
	a strong password yourself.

--script::
	After registration, print the command that can be used to finish the 
	registration in a format suitable for scripting purposes.

--agree::
	You agree to Mega.co.nz terms of service.
