megarc(5)
=========

NAME
----
megarc - Configuration file for megatools


SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'~/.megarc'
'./.megarc'


DESCRIPTION
-----------

Megatools use INI configuration file to store commonly used login credentials.
This makes it less bothersome to use the tools, as you can simply write

--------
$ megadf
--------

instead of

--------
$ megadf --username my@email.com --password mypass
--------

when using the tools.

Configuration file is read either from the current directory or user's home
directory. Exceptions are when `--ignore-config-file` was passed to the tool, or
when explicit path to the config file was given via `--config <path>`.


CONFIG FILE SECTIONS
--------------------

All sections are optional.


[Login] Section
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Username::
	Your username.

Password::
	Your password.


[Cache] Section

EXAMPLE
-------

------------
[Login]
Username = your@email
Password = yourpassword
------------

Run man:megadf[1] to check that megatools are able to login to your account.
